                             MICHAEL
              Yes.

                             ROTH
              What a mistake; people behaving
              like that, with guns.
                       (he shakes his
                        head)
              It was my understanding we left all
              that behind.  But, let me tell you,
              the important thing is that you're
              all right.  Good health is the most
              important thing; more than success;
              more than power; more than money.

                             MICHAEL
              The incident of the other night is
              a nuisance that I can take care of.
              I came to you because I want nothing
              to affect our agreement; I wanted
              to clear everything I'm going to
              do with you, just in case.

                             ROTH
              You're a considerate young man.

                             MICHAEL
              You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have
              much to learn from you.

                             ROTH
                       (warmly)
              However I can help you...

                             MICHAEL
              The Rosato Brothers have performed
              services for you in the past; I
              understand that they are under your
              protection.

                             ROTH
                       (simply)
              We do favors for each other...

                             MICHAEL
              Technically, they are still under
              the Clemenza wing of the Corleone
              Family, now run by Frankie
              Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
              the Rosatos wanted territory of
              their own.  Pentangeli refused, and
              came to me, asking for permission
              to eliminate them.
