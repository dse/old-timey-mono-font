# Reproducing Typewriter

A clean digital revival of Reproducing Typewriter, a monospace
typeface from as early as 1906.  Reproducing Typewriter was designed
for simulating typewritten letters in smaller point sizes for
advertisements, catalogs, etc., where readability and/or distortion
resulting from duplication were issues.

Typefaces were also available to simulate the fonts used by actual
typewriters like Remington, Smith, and Underwood; but Reproducing
Typewriter is more readable at smaller point sizes than those.

I believe this also makes Reproducing Typewriter a good basis for a
coding font with an antique aesthetic, that being this font.

You may have seen this typeface used in the [Turbo Pascal 3.0](turbo)
product manual.

At a size of 12pt (6 lines per inch), Reproducing Typewriter is a pica
font, or 10 characters per inch, like Courier.  It **should** be
suitable for screenplay writing!

## Reproducing Typewriter Code

Reproducing Typewriter Code makes the following changes:

-   A modified digit `0` to be better distinguishable from the
    uppercase letter `O`.

-   A modified digit `1` to be better distinguishable from the
    lowercase letter `l`.

-   Certain punctuation marks are made larger for better visibility.

## Not Exactly The Same as the Original.

-   The percent sign had to be shifted up a bit to stay within the
    character cell without modifying the baseline, cap-height, ascent,
    descent, and other dimensions.

-   These are monoline fonts whereas the originals weren't, but they
    were close to it.

-   Cap height is slightly different.

-   Not all characters in this typeface are original to Reproducing
    Typewriter.
