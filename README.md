# Reproducing Typewriter

A clean monospace typeface based on of Reproducing Typewriter, a
monospace typeface from as early as 1906.  Reproducing Typewriter was
designed for simulating typewritten letters in smaller point sizes for
advertisements, catalogs, etc., where readability and/or distortion
resulting from duplication were issues with faces based on actual
typewriters at the time.

"Sight Saver" typewriter faces designed for readability were also
available, though they were at larger sizes than ordinary pica or
elite typefaces.

I developed this because I believe those characteristics also make
Reproducing Typewriter a good basis for a coding font (this one) with
an antique aesthetic.  You may have seen this typeface used in the
[Turbo Pascal 3.0](turbo) product manual.

At a size of 12pt (6 lines per inch), Reproducing Typewriter is a pica
font, or 10 characters per inch, like Courier.  It **should** be
suitable for screenplay writing.

## Code Variant

Along with the regular variant, a variant for coding is also
available, with a slashed zero, disambiguated digit one, selected
punctuation marks made larger, and a few certain small letters
modified.

to do this.
