# Reproducing Typewriter

## Introducing Reproducing Typewriter

Reproducing Typewriter is one of many early 20th-century typefaces
used for simulating typewritten letters on hot metal and/or mechanical
typesetting equipment.  As opposed to typefaces resembling those of
typewriter manufacturers such as Remington and Smith, Reproducing
Typewriter appears to have been designed for better readability at
smaller point sizes and/or when reproduced by mimeograph machines and
whatnots.

According to the American Type Founders [Line
Book](https://bit.ly/atflinebook1908) of 1908:

> A specialty has also been made of Reproducing Typewriter faces, to
> meet the constantly increasing demand for facsimile letters in
> reduced size.

Its main differentiating characteristic from other contemporaneous
typewriter styles is that most serifs are shorter.  Where the serifs
of other typefaces might bleed together, the capital H, for example,
continues to look more like a capital H.

## How We Were Likely Introduced to Reproducing Typewriter

Reproducing Typewriter, or something very close to it, is also the
typeface used for code examples in the _Turbo Pascal 3.0_ manual.  I
cut my teeth on Turbo Pascal!

## Original and Coding Variants

I created this with the hope that its shorter serifs also make it a
more suitable basis for a coding-friendly typeface than other
old-timey typewriter fonts.

**Reproducing Typewriter** is to a great extent the original typeface.

**Reproducing Typewriter Code** makes the following changes:

-   The digits `0` and `1` are modified for disambiguity with the
    capital `O` and small `l`.

-   The period, comma, and other selected punctuation marks are made
    larger for better visibility.
    
## Reproducing Reproducing Typewriter

This is the first digitally available clean version of Reproducing
Typewriter.

I created this by tracing from scans of the Turbo Pascal manual as
well as scans of typeface specimens.  So it may not be super accurate,
but in my experience it's close enough.

## Unicode Coverage

-   U+0000–U+007F Basic Latin: all printable ASCII characters.  No
    control characters, obviously.

-   U+0080–U+00FF Latin-1 Supplement: all printable ISO-8859-1
    characters.  Again, no control characters.

-   U+2800–U+28FF Braille Patterns in its entirety.

-   U+2500–U+257F Box Drawing in its entirety.

-   U+2580–U+259F Block Elements in its entirety.

### In Progress

-   A lot of extended Latin symbols.

-   Some Greek and Cyrillic symbols.

-   Plenty of additional punctuation marks, mathematical operators,
    geometric shapes, and basic arrows from U+2000 on up.
