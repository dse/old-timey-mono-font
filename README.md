# Reproducing Typewriter

This is the first digital clean revival of Reproducing Typewriter.

Reproducing Typewriter is a monospace typeface created over a century
ago for use with mechanical typesetting machines in use at the time.
It was designed for creating simulacra of typewritten letters in
smaller point sizes for advertisements, catalogs, and other printed
materials.

Typefaces were also available to simulate the fonts used by actual
contemporaneous typewriters such as Remington, Smith, and Underwood;
but Reproducing Typewriter is more readable at smaller point sizes
than those.

You may have seen this typeface used in the [Turbo Pascal 3.0](turbo)
product manual.

At a size of 12pt (6 lines per inch), Reproducing Typewriter is a pica
font, or 10 characters per inch, like Courier.  It **should** be
suitable for screenplay writing!

## Reproducing Typewriter Code

Reproducing Typewriter Code makes the following changes:

-   A modified digit `0` to be better distinguishable from the
    uppercase letter `O`.

-   A modified digit `1` to be better distinguishable from the
    lowercase letter `l`.

-   Certain punctuation marks are made larger for better visibility.

## Unicode Coverage

-   U+0000–U+007F Basic Latin: all printable ASCII characters.  No
    control characters, obviously.

-   U+0080–U+00FF Latin-1 Supplement: all printable ISO-8859-1
    characters.  Again, no control characters.

-   U+2500–U+257F Box Drawing in its entirety.

-   U+2580–U+259F Block Elements in its entirety.

-   U+2800–U+28FF Braille Patterns in its entirety.

-   All Cyrillic used in Russia and Ukraine.

-   All modern uppercase Greek.  Lowercase to come.

-   Plenty of additional punctuation marks, mathematical operators,
    geometric shapes, and basic arrows from U+2000 on up.  More to
    come, probably.
