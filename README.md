# Reproducing Reproducing Typewriter

Reproducing Typewriter is (mostly) the typeface used for code examples
and such in the _Turbo Pascal 3.0_ manual, with digits `0` and `1`
modified for disambiguity, and a larger period, comma, colon,
semicolon, and "curly quotes" for better visibility.  That's where I
first saw it and I thought it was the best thing ever at the time.

It has an old-timey appearance, but serifs are somewhat muted compared
to most contemporaneous typewriter fonts, _arguably_ making it a
halfway reasonable coding font.  According to the American Type
Founders [Line Book](https://bit.ly/atflinebook1908) of 1908:

> A specialty has also been made of Reproducing Typewriter faces, to
> meet the constantly increasing demand for facsimile letters in
> reduced size.

This is a mostly-accurate reproduction in digital form, traced the
best I could from various samples and with lots of dimensions then
"evened out".
