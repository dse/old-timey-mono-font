-   Add GSUB lookups for all `cvxx`.  Call the GSUB lookups `cvxx`.

### These are Suggestions.

-   Dotted zero variant.

-   "Looking at the examples, they look good, though one thing stands
    out, the 'w' seems to be bolder than the other letters. The 'm'
    seems fine, as do the other letters and symbols, just the 'w'."

-   "You wouldn't consider changing license to Apache-2.0, or dual
    license under that?"

-   "allow combining breve over Latin y as well: sometimes that's handy
    for indicating contrast"
    
    So, combining marks well sometimes and not well other times.
    
    Examples of times where they don't work: Notepad
    
    This may be due to lack of anchors.  Quite frankly they would
    solve some issues I've been experiencing with auto placement.
    
    Also:
    
    -   https://alanwood.net/unicode/combining_diacritical_marks.html

-   "check the height of stacking diacritical marks: a perispomenos
    tonos or circumflex accent over a breathing mark over a vowel
    (like in εἶναι eĩnai) ends up stacking up tall enough to intersect
    with descenders (like on ζ zeta) from the line above"
    
    This is hard.

-   the circumflex over alpha (ᾶ) looks really good, because it
    follows the curve of the alpha itself, but circumflex over eta (ῆ)
    looks off-center, because it left-aligns to the ear on the left of
    eta. The same could be said for the iota subscript (ᾳῃῳ): it looks
    great under alpha and omega, but it's a bit awkward under eta
    because of how far to the left it is.
    
    Another accent placement issue.

-   have you considered adding a variation for the Porsonic or
    single-curve circumflex?

    I need to figure out which combining mark that would be.
    
-   "Just the uppercase variant ẞ - the lowercase ß _is_
    there. Notably, uppercase ẞ didn't exist at the time the source
    typeface was designed – it was only officially adopted 111 years
    later in 2017."

-   "I can't tell if you're aiming for a faithful reproduction of the
    original font, or to make the coding font modern and most useful
    to today's developer. But... Can the code variant have the
    asterisk used to represent multiplication be on the same line as
    other math operators like plus, minus, and tilde? +-~* I always
    like the asterisk to be in line with the others. Maybe I am just
    weird. Also for the code variant I think the pound or hash mark #
    could be reduced in drama a little, to fit in with the other
    punctuation marks. Thanks for listening to my two cents."
