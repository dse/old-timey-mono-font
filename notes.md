# Notes

## Special Glyph Names

`<glyphname>.smol` are autogenerated.

`<glyphname>.simpl` are special versions of glyphs with things like
bulbs removed, with the goal that `zero.sm`, `one.sm`, etc. are
generated from them instead of the regular letters.

`<glyphname>.orig` are intended to duplicate symbols from the original
Reproducing Typewriter font.

## Glyph Files

`u+xxxx.svg` are normal glyphs.

`u+xxxx--suffix.svg` are used to create `<glyphname>.<suffix>` glyphs.

`x--glyphname.svg` are used to create special glyphs without a Unicode
encoding.
